### Compatibility

This theme has been designed for use on [SlickStack](https://slickstack.io) web servers with PHP 7.2 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our themes are meant primarily for single site WordPress installations — for both performance and usability reasons, we strongly recommend avoiding WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of your projects.

Any of our WordPress plugins may also be loaded as "Must-Use" plugins (meaning that they load first, and cannot be deactivated) by using our free [Autoloader](https://github.com/littlebizzy/autoloader) script in the `mu-plugins` directory.

### Our Philosophy

> "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." — **Albert Einstein** (et al)

> "Write programs that do one thing and do it well... write programs to work together." — **Doug McIlroy**

> "The innovation that this industry talks about so much is bullshit. Anybody can innovate... 99% of it is 'get the work done.' The real work is in the details." — **Linus Torvalds**
